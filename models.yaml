# ==============================================================================
# MODELS CONFIGURATION (models.yaml)
# ==============================================================================
# This file lets you adhere specific rules to specific models.
#
# YAML BASICS:
# - Everything after a '#' is a comment (ignored by the computer).
# - Indentation matters! Use spaces (2 or 4), not tabs.
# - Lists are created with '-', but here we mostly use "Keys" (like "gemma3:12b").
#
# HOW CONCURRENCY WORKS (The "Levers"):
# We use a system of "Points" or "Usage %" to decide if two things can run together.
# - cpu_usage: How much CPU does this take? (0-100)
# - gpu_usage: How much GPU? (0-100)
# - exclusive: If "true", this model is a DIVA. It runs alone. No one else allowed.
#
# SCORING (Who goes first?):
# - base_priority: Higher number = Higher importance. (e.g., 10 beats 1).
# - load_penalty: Deduct points if the system is busy (Advanced).
#

models:
  # Example 1: A lightweight model that plays nice with others.
  # "gemma3:12b_it_qat" is the exact ID used by Ollama/LM Studio.
  "gemma3:12b_it_qat":
    base_priority: 2        # Standard priority
    resources:
      cpu_usage: 20.0       # Takes ~20% of our abstract CPU budget
      gpu_usage: 10.0       # Takes ~10% of our GPU budget
                            # Conclusion: You could run ~5 of these at once before hitting 100%.

  # Example 2: A Heavy Coding Model
  "deepseek-coder:67b":
    base_priority: 10       # High Priority! Cut in line if possible.
    resources:
      exclusive: true       # THE "LEVER": Runs entirely alone. 
                            # If this starts, everyone else waits.
                            # If others are running, this waits for them to finish.

  # Example 3: A standard model (defaults)
  "llama3":
    base_priority: 5
    resources:
      cpu_usage: 50.0       # Takes half the computer.
      gpu_usage: 50.0       # Takes half the GPU.
      # You can run 2 of these, or 1 of these + 2 Gemmas.
